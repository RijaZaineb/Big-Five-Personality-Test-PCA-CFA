# Big Five Personality Test PCA CFA
This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Common Factor Analysis (CFA) on the Big Five Personality dataset to identify underlying personality traits. It focuses on dimensionality reduction and interpretation of personality dimensions based on 50 variables from 19,719 respondents, using R for statistical analysis.
### Objectives
1.	Validate assumptions for PCA and CFA.
2.	Identify optimal components and interpret their psychological relevance.
3.	Compare PCA and CFA in understanding personality dimensions.
### Methodology
•	Assumption Testing: KMO adequacy was 0.91, and Bartlett’s test was significant, confirming suitability for PCA/CFA.

•	Dimensionality Reduction: The knee and eigenvalue methods suggested 5 components, representing the Big Five personality traits.

•	Model Refinement: Adjusted cutoff values for loadings and removed non-contributing variables (N4) for clarity in component structure.

•	Interpretation of Components: Components corresponded to Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness.

•	CFA Comparison: Highlighted similarities in grouping but noted reduced loadings and cumulative variance due to CFA’s exclusion of unique/error variances.
### Results
#### •	Principal Components: 
  5 components explained 46.1% variance in PCA, while CFA explained 40.1%.
#### •	Component Interpretation:
  o	Extraversion: High scores indicate outgoing nature
  
  o	Neuroticism: High scores suggest emotional instability
  
  o	Agreeableness: High scores denote empathy and cooperativeness
  
  o	Conscientiousness: High scores reflect self-discipline
  
  o	Openness: High scores show openness to new experiences
### Impact
This analysis successfully identifies core personality dimensions, using PCA and CFA for comprehensive profiling. It demonstrates expertise in statistical methods for psychometric data, valuable in areas like HR, marketing, and psychology. The project showcases a robust approach to dimensionality reduction and provides interpretable personality insights, making it highly applicable for portfolio presentation.
### Skills Demonstrated
•	Dimensionality Reduction: Proficient in PCA and CFA for reducing complex datasets.

•	Statistical Analysis in R: Competent use of libraries for PCA, CFA, and reliability analysis.

•	Data Interpretation: Deriving meaningful psychological constructs from statistical results.

•	Problem-Solving: Adaptive approach to adjust model and interpret results across different statistical methods.

### Key Takeaways
This project highlights technical and analytical skills in PCA and CFA, important for data-driven insights into behavioral datasets. It exemplifies the ability to extract meaningful patterns in large datasets, reinforcing competencies in statistical analysis and interpretation suitable for diverse data science applications.
